# PREDICTING MEDICAL INSURANCE CHARGE USING MULTIPLE LINEAR REGRESSION MODEL
## *ðŸ“Œ Overview*  
This project analyzes a medical insurance dataset and builds a predictive model to estimate *insurance charges* based on various factors like age, BMI, smoking status, and region.  

## *ðŸ“‚ Dataset*  
- *Source:* [Kaggle - Medical Insurance Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mirichoi0218/insurance)  
- *Description:* The dataset contains *1,338* records with *7 columns*, including
  personal and health-related details.  
- *Columns:*  
  - age: Age of the individual  
  - sex: Gender (male or female)  
  - bmi: Body Mass Index (BMI)  
  - children: Number of dependent children  
  - smoker: Whether the person is a smoker (yes or no)  
  - region: Residential region (northeast, northwest, southeast, southwest)  
  - charges: Medical insurance cost (target variable)  

## *ðŸ“Š Objective*  
- Perform *Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)* to understand correlations.  
- Build *Machine Learning models* (Linear Regression, Ridge Regression, etc.) to predict insurance costs.  
- Deploy the model using *Streamlit / Flask*.
